# Exam Score Prediction Project

This project predicts students’ exam scores using machine learning regression models. It explores both single-feature and multivariate regression to understand how different input variables affect exam performance.

## Overview

The project analyzes the relationship between study-related factors and exam scores. The data is explored visually, then multiple regression models are trained and compared to evaluate their performance.

Both **simple regression** and **multivariate regression** approaches are used, along with regularization techniques.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

## What This Project Covers

- Data loading and exploration  
- Checking for missing values  
- Data visualization  
- Feature selection and preparation  
- Training a Linear Regression model  
- Training a Multivariate Regression model  
- Training a Ridge Regression model  
- Comparing model performance  

## Results

The analysis shows a strong relationship between the input features and exam scores. Multivariate regression improves prediction by considering more than one factor, while Ridge Regression helps control model complexity through regularization. The models perform well and allow meaningful comparison.

## Limitations

- The dataset is relatively small  
- Only available features in the dataset are used  
- Results are mainly for learning and experimentation  

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run the cells sequentially  

## Purpose of the Project

This project was created to practice regression modeling, feature handling, model comparison, and evaluation using Python.

## Future Improvements

- Add more relevant features  
- Experiment with additional regression techniques  
- Improve evaluation and validation methods
