# Exam Score Prediction Project

This project predicts a student’s exam score based on the number of hours studied using machine learning. It was created as a learning project to understand regression models and how study time relates to exam performance.

## Overview

The project explores the relationship between **study hours** and **exam scores**. The data is visualized, regression models are trained, and their performance is evaluated to assess prediction accuracy.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

## What This Project Covers

- Data loading and exploration  
- Checking for missing values  
- Data visualization  
- Training a Linear Regression model  
- Training a Ridge Regression model  
- Model evaluation  

## Results

The results show a clear linear relationship between study hours and exam scores. This makes linear regression an appropriate model for this problem and allows for reasonable predictions.

## Limitations

- Only one feature (study hours) is used  
- Other factors affecting exam scores are not included  
- Dataset is small and intended for learning purposes  

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run the cells step by step  

## Purpose of the Project

This project was built to practice basic machine learning concepts such as regression, model training, evaluation, and data visualization using Python.

## Future Improvements

- Add more features to improve prediction accuracy  
- Experiment with other regression models  
- Improve model evaluation and comparison
